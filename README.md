### LeetCode Challenges

This repo holds recent challenges that I've worked on in LeetCode, as a showcase.

##### Notes:

- `src/array` holds array problems by number, likewise `src/string` holds string problems.
- `*.test.ts` files live next to their source files. The pattern is `src/array/26/26.ts` and `src/array/26/26.test.ts`.
- Run all the tests with `npm test:all`
- Run individual problems with `npm test array 26`
- Scaffold individual problem folders with `npm run make string 46`
